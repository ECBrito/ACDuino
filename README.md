ACDuino: Automated Car Air Conditioning Control Using Arduino
Overview
This project presents an innovative and efficient approach to the automated control of a vehicle's air conditioning system using an Arduino-based platform. The developed solution integrates pressure sensors, temperature probes, and relay modules to continuously monitor the thermal and pressure conditions within the refrigeration circuit. Based on real-time data, the system autonomously determines the optimal moments to activate or deactivate the fan and compressor, ensuring optimized and efficient operation.

Components
Arduino Uno: The central microcontroller used to process data from sensors and control the relay module.

Pressure sensor (0-500 PSI, 0-5V output): Measures the pressure within the air conditioning system to ensure optimal performance and safety.

Temperature probe (OneWire DS18B20): Provides accurate temperature readings, allowing the system to adjust the air conditioning based on real-time conditions.

Relay module for fan and compressor control: Acts as a switch to turn the fan and compressor on or off based on the data received from the sensors.

Power supply and wiring: Supplies the necessary power to the Arduino and other components, ensuring stable and reliable operation.
